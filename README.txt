==[ teeny tiny site builder ]==================================================

I made this tiny static site concept maybe around a year ago, but never 
published it. Recently I've been looking at static site generators like zola 
and hugo, but most themes are either not my thing or full of unnecessary html/
javascript, and creating themes for them is a whole other thing. 

I might tweak this code base in the near future to make it more suitable for 
what I want. Right now it only supports just inserts the input files as they 
are into the template. The included css uses a monospace font, so this is 
suitable for both txt and html input files.

You will probably want to tweak the template.html file if you choose to use 
this program.
